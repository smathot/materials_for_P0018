# Demonstration

This demonstration experiment allows you to experience intrasaccadic perception; that is, it shows that you can see while your eyes move.

You need:

- a monitor that ideally
	- has a high refresh rate (> 100 Hz), and
	- is gamma-calibrated
- [OpenSesame](http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/), which is free software that is needed to run the experiment.

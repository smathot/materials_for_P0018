It is commonly believed that vision is suppressed during saccadic eye movements. However, here we report that some visual stimuli are clearly visible during saccades, and trigger a constriction of the eye's pupil. Participants viewed sinusoid gratings that changed polarity 150 times per second (every 6.67 ms). At this rate of flicker, the gratings were perceived as homogeneous surfaces while participants fixated. But when participants made a saccade, the eye's velocity briefly matched the gratings' spatiotemporal frequency. As a result, the retinal image was approximately static for a brief moment during the saccade, and this gave rise to an intrasaccadic percept: A normally invisible stimulus became visible when eye-velocity was maximal. Our results confirm and extend previous studies by demonstrating intrasaccadic perception using a reflexive measure (pupillometry) that does not rely on subjective report. We suggest that visual perception during saccades is best understood in terms of predictive coding: The retinal motion that occurs during saccades is predictable, offers no evidence for motion in the environment, and is therefore not perceived. But when intrasaccadic retinal input violates the predictions, a clear intrasaccadic percept arises.

It is commonly believed that vision is suppressed during saccadic eye movements. However, here we report that some visual stimuli are clearly visible during saccades, and trigger a constriction of the eye's pupil. Participants viewed sinusoid gratings that changed polarity 150 times per second (every 6.67 ms). These gratings contained ambiguous motion: Vertical gratings could be interpreted as rightward or leftward motion; horizontal gratings could be interpreted as upward or downward motion. At this rate of flicker, the gratings were perceived as homogeneous surfaces while participants fixated. But when participants made a saccade, the eye's peak velocity matched the gratings' motion (in one direction). As a result, the retinal image was approximately static for a brief moment during the saccade, and this gave rise to an intrasaccadic percept: A normally invisible stimulus became visible when eye velocity was maximal. Our results confirm and extend previous studies by demonstrating intrasaccadic perception using a reflexive measure (pupillometry) that does not rely on subjective report. We suggest that visual perception during saccades is best understood in terms of predictive coding: The retinal motion that occurs during saccades is predictable, offers no evidence for motion in the environment, and is therefore not perceived. But when intrasaccadic retinal input violates predictions, a clear intrasaccadic percept arises.

When you look at yourself in the mirror, you are confronted with an unrelenting stare. It seems that you make no eye movements. Which is odd, because everyone else does.

The inability to see your own saccadic eye movements is a simple yet powerful demonstration of saccadic omission: You generally don't perceive events that occur while your eyes are moving, including (tautologically) your own saccades. Saccadic omission is often considered to be a mechanism that prevents you from seeing the world move when your eyes move [e.g., @RossBurrMorrone1996BehavBrainRes]. That is, the retinal-image movement that results from a saccade is omitted from consciousness.

Saccadic omission affects most if not all aspects of visual processing. Psychophysical studies have shown that visual sensitivity is reduced during a ± 100 ms window around a saccade [@Zuber1966Visual;@Diamond2000], especially for stimuli with a low spatial frequency [@BurrMorroneRoss1994]. Neurophysiological studies have shown that stimuli presented during that same window elicit reduced neural activity in many visual brain areas [@Bremmer2009;@Thiele2002]. Saccadic omission even affects the pupillary light response: The pupillary constriction that results from a flash of light is reduced when the flash occurs around the time of a saccade [@Zuber1966Pupil].

The finding that saccadic omission starts already before the eyes set in motion has inspired the hypothesis that it results from an active suppressive mechanism that relies on knowledge of intended movement [i.e. a corollary discharge or efference copy @Sperry1950;@Von+holst1950]. According to the active-suppression hypothesis, when a saccade is prepared, motor areas inform visual areas of the intended movement [reviewed in @CrapseSommer2008]. As a result, visual areas briefly reduce their excitability.

However, the active-suppression hypothesis does not explain all findings. Notably, intrassacadic perception is not always suppressed. Sometimes you can see while your eyes move. This was elegantly shown by @CampbellWurtz1978. In their experiment, participants sat in the dark and made a saccade. Crucially, when the experimental room was illuminated during the saccade, participants perceived a smeared out image of the room. In other words, participants clearly saw the retinal image motion that, according the active-suppression hypothesis, should be suppressed. However, when the room was also illuminated during a brief period before and after the saccade, smearing was no longer perceived. In other words, intrasaccadic perception occurred only in isolation, and not when sandwiched between a pre- and postsaccadic percept. Intrasaccadic perception has also been demonstrated with stimuli that, under normal circumstances, move too rapidly to be seen. Saccades can make such stimuli visible, by reducing retinal image motion: When you make a saccade in the direction of the stimulus' movement, the velocity of the saccade briefly reduces (or even cancels) the retinal speed of the stimulus, which consequently becomes visible [@DeubelElsner1986Saccadic;@CastetMasson2000@CastetJeanjean2002;@Garc2001]. Phrased differently, a saccade can make an otherwise invisible stimulus visible by briefly stabilizing it on the retina.

The finding that saccadic omission occurs only when there is a clear pre- and postsaccadic percept has inspired the hypothesis that it results from masking [reviewed in @Castet2010]. That is, saccadic omission is due to the fact that you cannot see a brief stimulus (the intrasaccadic percept) when it is preceded and/ or followed by another stimulus [@Enns2000Masking]. The passive-masking hypothesis, while not strictly an explanation (after all, what is masking?), at least reduces saccadic omission to another well established phenomenon.

There are therefore two main findings: Intrasaccadic perception is actively suppressed most of the time, as emphasized by the active-suppression hypothesis; But sometimes, intrasaccadic perception is not suppressed all, as emphasized by the passive-masking hypothesis. The interpretation of these findings is still debated [see e.g. @Castet2010], and, in our view, has been obfuscated by vehicle-content confusion: the assumption that we consciously perceive (content) our retina (vehicle). We suspect that most researchers reject this assumption when made explicit, but it is nevertheless the basis of the question why we don't we see movement when our eyes move. We believe that it is more fruitful to think about saccadic omission in terms of predictive coding [as proposed by many, e.g. @Mackay1972;@ReganNoë2001]. Saccadic omission can then be explained as follows: Retinal image motion is a predictable consequence of saccades, and therefore offers no evidence for motion in the outside world, and therefore does not lead to perception of motion. Intrasaccadic perception is then explained as follows: When retinal image motion during a saccade is not as predicted, this offers evidence for something 'unusual' in the outside world, and therefore leads to an intrassacadic percept. This explains why intrasaccadic perception is possible, but occurs only in contrived laboratory settings.

Here we aim to provide a direct demonstration of intrasaccadic perception that does not rely on subjective report. To this end, we used a paradigm similar to that used by @CastetMasson2000, and measured pupillary responses to an intrasaccadic stimuli. Under normal conditions, foveally presented stimuli trigger a pupillary constriction, even when there is no change in overall luminance [e.g., @Gamlin1998;@Slooten1980;@Ukai1985]. Therefore, we predicted that an intrassacadic stimulus would also trigger a pupillary constriction (or a rather an enlargement of the pupillary constriction that is generally observed after a saccade). In addition to providing the first evidence of intrasaccadic perception that does not rely on self-report, this would show that intrasaccadic perception is similar to regular perception, not only in eliciting a conscious percept, but also in triggering a reflexive pupillary response.

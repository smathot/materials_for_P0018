When you look at yourself in the mirror, it seems that you make no eye movements. And that is odd, because everyone else does.

The inability to see your own saccadic eye movements is a simple yet powerful demonstration of saccadic suppression: You generally do not perceive events that occur while your eyes are moving, including (tautologically) your own saccades. Phrased differently, the retinal-image motion that results from saccades is suppressed, at least in the sense that it is not consciously perceived. Saccadic suppression is sometimes considered a mechanism that prevents you from seeing the world move when your eyes move [e.g., @RossBurrMorrone1996]. However, this functional interpretation is controversial [e.g. @Castet2010;@ReganNoë2001], and here we use saccadic suppression as an umbrella term for various findings that show that vision is impaired around the time of saccades.

Saccadic suppression affects most if not all aspects of visual processing. Psychophysical studies have shown that visual sensitivity is reduced during a ± 100 ms window around saccades [@Zuber1966Visual;@Diamond2000;@Volkmann1978], especially for non-isoluminant stimuli with a low spatial frequency [@BurrMorroneRoss1994;@KnBinda2011]+[; but see @Braun2015Changes]. Neurophysiological studies have shown that stimuli presented during that same window elicit reduced neural activity in many visual brain areas [@Bremmer2009;@Thiele2002]. Saccadic suppression even affects the pupillary light response: The pupillary constriction that is triggered by a flash of light is reduced when the flash occurs around the time of a saccade [@Lorber1965Pupil;@Zuber1966Pupil].

However, saccadic suppression is not complete; sometimes you can see while the eyes move, a phenomenon that we will refer to as *intrasaccadic perception*. Intrasaccadic perception can even be very conspicuous, as was elegantly shown by Campbell and Wurtz [-@CampbellWurtz1978]. In their experiment, participants sat in the dark and made a saccade. Crucially, if the experimental room was illuminated during the saccade, participants perceived a smeared-out image of the room—an intrasaccadic percept. But this only happened when the illumination period fell entirely within the saccade. If the room was also briefly illuminated before or after the saccade, smearing was no longer perceived; instead, participants perceived a static image of the room. In other words, intrasaccadic perception occurred only when there was no pre- or postsaccadic visual stimulation; otherwise, the intrasaccadic percept was not consciously perceived, presumably because it was masked by the pre- and postsaccadic percept [reviewed in @Castet2010]. Intrasaccadic perception has also been demonstrated with stimuli that move too rapidly to be seen with static eyes (e.g., a vertical grating that moves across a display with a speed of 400 °/s). Saccades can make such stimuli visible by reducing retinal-image motion: When you make a saccade in the direction of the stimulus' movement (i.e. perpendicular to the grating's orientation), the velocity of the saccade briefly reduces, or even cancels, the retinal speed of the stimulus, which is consequently perceived as a static or moving percept, depending on the stimulus and the eye movement's velocity [@DeubelElsner1986Saccadic;@CastetMasson2000;@Garc2001]. Phrased differently, a saccade can make a normally invisible stimulus visible by briefly reducing, or even canceling, its retinal speed. This is a striking phenomenon that we will use in the present study as well. (We also provide demonstration software, as described under Methods.)

To date, intrasaccadic perception has only been demonstrated through subjective report. In a typical experiment, participants first make a saccade, and then indicate whether or not they perceived something (a flash or a movement) during the saccade. Here we use pupillometry to provide a direct demonstration of intrasaccadic perception that does not rely on subjective report. To this end, we used a paradigm similar to that used by Castet and Masson [-@CastetMasson2000], and measured pupillary responses, which are increasingly recognized as a powerful tool for vision science [for recent reviews, see @BindaMurray2014Trends;@Math2015Curr]. Under normal conditions, centrally presented visual stimuli trigger a pupillary constriction, even when there is no change in overall luminance [e.g., @Gamlin1998;@Slooter1980;@Ukai1985]. Therefore, we predicted that an intrassacadic stimulus, which in our view is not fundamentally different from any other stimulus, would also trigger a pupillary constriction [or rather a strengthening of the pupillary constriction that is generally observed after a saccade; @Mathôt2015Prep;@Zuber1966Pupil].

If we would find a pupillary constriction to intrasaccadic perception, this would be important for two main reasons. Firstly, our study avoids expectation effects that were not addressed previously: The knowledge that you may see something during a saccade may by itself increase the saliency of the intrasaccadic percept, and, in the extreme case, even induce a 'placebo percept'. Therefore, we tested only naïve observers, and we did not inform them beforehand that they might perceive 'something odd' during a saccade. Secondly, a pupillary constriction to intrasaccadic perception would show that intrasaccadic perception is similar to regular perception, not only in eliciting a conscious percept, but also in triggering a reflexive pupillary response.

When you look at yourself in the mirror, it seems that you make no eye movements. And that is odd, because everyone else does.

The inability to see your own saccadic eye movements is a simple yet powerful demonstration of saccadic omission (or suppression): You generally do not perceive events that occur while your eyes are moving, including (tautologically) your own saccades. Phrased differently, the retinal-image motion that results from saccades is omitted from consciousness. Historically, saccadic omission was considered a mechanism that prevents you from seeing the world move when your eyes move [e.g., @RossBurrMorrone1996].

Saccadic omission affects most if not all aspects of visual processing. Psychophysical studies have shown that visual sensitivity is reduced during a ± 100 ms window around saccades [@Zuber1966Visual;@Diamond2000], especially for stimuli with a low spatial frequency [@BurrMorroneRoss1994]. Neurophysiological studies have shown that stimuli presented during that same window elicit reduced neural activity in many visual brain areas [@Bremmer2009;@Thiele2002]. Saccadic omission even affects the pupillary light response: The pupillary constriction that is triggered by a flash of light is reduced when the flash occurs around the time of a saccade [@Zuber1966Pupil].

The finding that saccadic omission starts already before the eyes set in motion has inspired the hypothesis that it results from a suppressive mechanism that relies on knowledge of intended movement [i.e. a corollary discharge or efference copy; @Sperry1950;@Von+holst1950]. According to the active-suppression hypothesis, when a saccade is prepared, motor areas inform visual areas of the intended movement [reviewed in @CrapseSommer2008], which briefly reduce their excitability in response.

However, saccadic ommision does not always occur: Sometimes you can see while the eyes move (intrasaccadic perception), and this is not easily explained by the active suppression hypothesis. Intrasaccadic perception was elegantly shown by Campbell and Wurtz [-@CampbellWurtz1978]. In their experiment, participants sat in the dark and made a saccade. Crucially, if the experimental room was illuminated during the saccade, participants perceived a smeared-out image of the room. In other words, participants clearly saw the retinal-image motion that, according the active-suppression hypothesis, should have been suppressed. But this only happened when the illumination period fell entirely within the saccade. If the room was also briefly illuminated before and after the saccade, smearing was no longer perceived, and participants perceived a static image of the room. In other words, intrasaccadic perception occurred only when there was no pre- or postsaccadic percept. Intrasaccadic perception has also been demonstrated with stimuli that move too rapidly to be seen (e.g., a vertical grating that moves across a display with a speed of 400 °/s). Saccades can make such stimuli visible by reducing retinal-image motion: When you make a saccade in the direction of the stimulus' movement, the velocity of the saccade briefly reduces (or even cancels) the retinal speed of the stimulus, which consequently becomes visible [@DeubelElsner1986Saccadic;@CastetMasson2000;@CastetJeanjean2002;@Garc2001]. Phrased differently, a saccade can make a normally invisible stimulus visible by briefly stabilizing it on the retina. This is a striking phenomenon that we will use in the present study as well. (We also provide demonstration software, as described under Methods.)

The finding that saccadic omission occurs only when there is a clear pre- and postsaccadic percept has inspired the hypothesis that it results from masking [@CampbellWurtz1978;reviewed in @Castet2010]. According to the passive-masking hypothesis, saccadic omission occurs because you cannot see a brief stimulus (such as an intrasaccadic percept) when it is preceded and/ or followed by another stimulus [@Enns2000Masking]. This is not strictly an explanation (after all, what is masking?), but at least reduces saccadic omission to the well-established phenomenon of masking.

There are thus two main findings: Intrasaccadic perception is actively suppressed most of the time, as emphasized by the active-suppression hypothesis; But sometimes, intrasaccadic perception is not suppressed at all, as emphasized by the passive-masking hypothesis. In our view, this debate has been obfuscated by vehicle-content confusion: the assumption that we consciously perceive (content) our retina (vehicle). Although we suspect that most researchers would reject this assumption when made explicit, it is nevertheless the basis of the question why we do not we see movement when our eyes move--a question that implies that conscious perception directly reflects the retinal image. We believe that it is more fruitful to think about saccadic omission in terms of predictive coding [similar ideas have been proposed in different contexts and using different terminology by e.g. @Clark2013;@Mackay1972;@ReganNoë2001].

According to predictive coding, saccadic omission is explained as follows: Retinal image motion is a predictable consequence of saccades, therefore offers no evidence for motion in the outside world, and therefore does not lead to perception of motion. This also explains why weak stimuli presented around the time of saccades are often not perceived [the classic saccadic omission finding, cf. @Zuber1966Visual]: The visual system assumes that changes in visual input around the time of saccades do not reflect real stimuli, but are due to the saccades themselves. And considerable evidence to the contrary is required to break this assumption. This explanation is analogous to that offered for the finding that people often fail to detect stimulus displacements across saccades [@Deubel1996Blanking; reviewed in @MathôtTheeuwes2011VisStab].

Similarly, according to predictive coding, intrasaccadic perception is explained as follows: When retinal image motion during a saccade strongly violates the prediction, this offers evidence for something 'unusual' in the outside world, and therefore leads to an intrassacadic percept. This explains why intrasaccadic perception is possible, and can even be very salient, but occurs only in contrived laboratory settings that violate your expectations of what the world is like. The predictive-coding hypothesis is similar to the active-suppression hypothesis in that it supposes a role for an extraretinal signal (i.e. the intended eye movement). However, this signal is not used to suppress vision, but to predict the retinal image motion that the intended eye movement will bring about.

Here we aim to provide a direct demonstration of intrasaccadic perception that does not rely on subjective report. To this end, we used a paradigm similar to that used by Castet and Masson [-@CastetMasson2000], and measured pupillary responses to intrasaccadic stimuli. Under normal conditions, centrally presented visual stimuli trigger a pupillary constriction, even when there is no change in overall luminance [e.g., @Gamlin1998;@Slooter1980;@Ukai1985]. Therefore, we predicted that an intrassacadic stimulus, which in our view is not fundamentally different from any other stimulus, would also trigger a pupillary constriction (or rather a strengthening of the pupillary constriction that is generally observed after a saccade). In addition to providing the first direct evidence for intrasaccadic perception that does not rely on subjective report, this would show that intrasaccadic perception is similar to regular perception, not only in eliciting a conscious percept, but also in triggering a reflexive pupillary response.
